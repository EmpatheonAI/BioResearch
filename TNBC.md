## Overview of Emerging Targeted and Immunotherapy Approaches in Early-Stage Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
### Introduction
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype defined by the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression. It comprises about 15–20% of breast cancers yet accounts for a disproportionate share of mortality​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. Early-stage TNBC (stages I–III) has high relapse rates even after standard therapy – approximately 50% of early-stage TNBC patients experience recurrence, and 37% die within five years of surgery, reflecting a poor prognosis​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. Unlike other breast cancers, TNBC lacks obvious drug targets, making treatment challenging and driving the need for new targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Recent advances, including the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, have begun to improve outcomes in early TNBC​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. This report outlines the latest preclinical strategies under investigation – highlighting specific biomarkers, molecular pathways, novel drug targets, experimental treatments, and key challenges – that aim to improve therapy for early-stage TNBC.

Molecular Pathways and Biomarkers in TNBC
TNBC is highly heterogeneous, consisting of multiple molecular subtypes with distinct biology. Lehmann’s classification identifies six TNBC subtypes: Basal-like 1 (BL1), Basal-like 2 (BL2), Mesenchymal (M), Mesenchymal Stem-Like (MSL), Immunomodulatory (IM), and Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR)​
MDPI.COM
. Each subtype is characterized by unique activated pathways and biomarkers: for example, BL1 tumors show upregulation of cell cycle and DNA damage response genes, BL2 tumors are enriched in growth factor signaling and glycolysis pathways, IM tumors have high expression of immune signaling genes, and LAR tumors are driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. These differences translate to varied responses to treatment and underscore the need for subtype-specific strategies.

Genomic analyses reveal common alterations across TNBC that present potential targets. The vast majority of TNBCs harbor TP53 mutations, and subsets exhibit defects in DNA repair (e.g. BRCA1/2 mutations) or activation of proliferative pathways​
MDPI.COM
. For instance, some TNBCs, especially BL1, have BRCA1/2 loss or mutations leading to homologous recombination deficiency, making them susceptible to DNA-damage targeting therapies​
MDPI.COM
. Others have amplifications or mutations in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (PIK3CA, AKT2) or RAS/MAPK pathway (KRAS, BRAF), and LAR tumors overexpress the androgen receptor, providing rational targets​
MDPI.COM
. On the immunological side, many TNBCs (particularly the IM subtype) are immunogenic – often infiltrated by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and expressing PD-L1 – which has opened the door for immune checkpoint blockade​
MDPI.COM
. However, predictive biomarkers for therapy response are still limited. PD-L1 expression and TIL levels correlate with immunotherapy benefit but are imperfect selectors, as PD-L1–positive tumors do not always respond​
MDPI.COM
. Likewise, the heterogeneity of TNBC means a single genetic marker (e.g. a PIK3CA mutation or EGFR overexpression) applies only to a subset of patients​
MDPI.COM
. Therefore, current research is intensely focused on identifying new biomarkers (genomic, protein, and immune-based) and understanding TNBC’s molecular pathways to guide the development of targeted treatments.

Targeted Therapy Approaches in Preclinical Research
Despite TNBC’s lack of hormone receptors or HER2, researchers have identified numerous molecular targets and are developing therapies against them. Several targeted therapy strategies are under preclinical and early clinical investigation, aiming to exploit TNBC’s genetic vulnerabilities or deregulated pathways:

DNA Damage Repair Inhibitors (PARP and beyond): TNBC commonly exhibits deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms, especially in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors such as olaparib and talazoparib have shown strong efficacy by inducing synthetic lethality in BRCA-mutant TNBC, leading to their approval in advanced disease​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Ongoing trials (e.g. OlympiA, NEOTALA) are now evaluating PARP inhibitors in the early-stage setting, with promising early results suggesting improved survival when used as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Beyond PARP, other DNA damage response targets like ATR and CHK1 kinases are being explored in TNBC models and early trials to overcome or complement PARP inhibitor therapy​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
.

Androgen Receptor and Cell Cycle Targets (LAR Subtype): The LAR subtype of TNBC, which expresses AR, can be targeted with androgen receptor antagonists (e.g. enzalutamide, abiraterone). These agents have shown favorable anti-tumor activity in AR-positive TNBC, including prolonged progression-free survival in trials​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Moreover, combining AR blockade with other treatments has synergistic potential – for example, preclinical studies indicate that adding AR inhibitors to PARP inhibitors or CDK4/6 inhibitors can enhance efficacy in AR-driven TNBC​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (like palbociclib and ribociclib), which halt cell cycle progression, are being repurposed for TNBC after success in ER+ breast cancers. Early evidence suggests CDK4/6 inhibitors may especially benefit LAR tumors, both alone and in combinations, although clinical optimization for TNBC is ongoing​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway Inhibitors: Aberrations in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (e.g. PIK3CA mutations) occur in a subset of TNBC, making this pathway an attractive target. PI3K inhibitors and downstream AKT/mTOR inhibitors have shown the ability to suppress TNBC tumor growth and induce cancer cell death in preclinical models​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Several early-phase trials are investigating these agents in TNBC, either as monotherapies or in combination with other treatments. While some activity has been observed, researchers are working to identify predictive biomarkers of response (such as the specific mutation profile) to better select patients who might benefit​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
.

Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) Inhibitors: TNBC often overexpresses growth factor receptors like EGFR (HER1) and may rely on angiogenesis signals (VEGFR). Efforts to target these pathways include small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies. For example, EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, erlotinib) were tested in TNBC clinical trials, but results have been mixed, possibly due to the lack of a clear EGFR-dependent subset​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Angiogenesis inhibitors (like bevacizumab targeting VEGF) have shown improved progression-free survival in some TNBC patients when added to chemotherapy, but without a biomarker their benefit is inconsistent. Current preclinical research is focusing on combination approaches (e.g. EGFR or VEGFR inhibitors with chemotherapy or other targeted agents) and on identifying tumor features that predict sensitivity to RTK inhibition​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
.

Epigenetic Therapies: Reversible epigenetic modifications are being targeted to reprogram TNBC cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as 5-azacitidine and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) like entinostat can induce tumor suppressor gene re-expression and make cancers more susceptible to other therapies. Early trials of DNMTi/HDACi combinations in refractory TNBC have shown only partial responses​
MDPI.COM
. However, an important finding is that epigenetic therapy may prime TNBC tumors for immunotherapy. For instance, giving entinostat (HDAC inhibitor) can modify the tumor microenvironment and is now being tested in combination with anti–PD-1 immunotherapy in TNBC (NCT04296942)​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. The main challenge with epigenetic drugs is their lack of specificity, but ongoing research is refining these “epidrugs” to better target cancer cells while sparing normal tissue.

Transcription Factor Inhibitors (Miniproteins): Many oncogenic transcription factors (e.g. MYC, SOX2) are considered “undruggable” by classical small molecules. Novel miniprotein/peptide inhibitors are being engineered as dominant-negatives to block critical protein–protein interactions in TNBC. For example, a mini-protein called Omomyc that targets the MYC transcription factor has shown the ability to suppress TNBC tumor growth in cell and animal models​
MDPI.COM
. Remarkably, Omomyc has progressed to a phase I trial (as a proof-of-concept biologic), where it demonstrated safety and included at least one TNBC patient​
MDPI.COM
. Other peptide inhibitors against transcription factors (like KJ-Pyr-9 against MYC, and peptides against HOX proteins) have shown preclinical activity in TNBC cells​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. While these agents face hurdles such as short half-life and potential immunogenicity, chemical modifications (cyclization, use of D-amino acids) are being employed to improve their stability​
MDPI.COM
. Targeting transcriptional networks in TNBC remains an exciting experimental avenue.

Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs): ADCs deliver potent cytotoxic drugs directly to cancer cells by targeting tumor-specific surface markers. A breakthrough in TNBC has been the ADC sacituzumab govitecan (targeting Trop-2), which showed significant efficacy in metastatic TNBC and gained FDA approval​
MDPI.COM
. Sacituzumab carries a topoisomerase inhibitor payload that is released inside Trop-2–expressing TNBC cells, causing cell death. Building on this success, ongoing preclinical studies are exploring ADC combinations (for example, sacituzumab with PARP inhibitors or with anti-apoptotic agents) to further enhance efficacy​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. New ADCs are also under development for TNBC, targeting other antigens (e.g. LIV-1 and folate receptor-alpha) with different payloads. These targeted conjugates exemplify how a targeted therapy can deliver chemotherapy more selectively to TNBC cells, improving the therapeutic index.

Radioconjugates: An emerging approach is to use tumor-targeted molecules to deliver radiation directly to cancer cells. In TNBC models, investigators have tested radionuclide-tagged agents that bind tumor-specific proteins. For example, a radioactive ligand [^177Lu]-NM600 (a phospholipid ether analog) showed encouraging results in a TNBC mouse model, achieving complete tumor regression in 60% of treated mice​
MDPI.COM
. Another study used a radiolabeled peptide targeting PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen, expressed on neovasculature of many tumors) and observed induction of apoptosis in TNBC cell line xenografts​
MDPI.COM
. These theranostic radioconjugates can both image and kill TNBC cells, offering a precision therapy with minimal collateral damage to normal tissue. While still experimental, their success in preclinical studies suggests potential for TNBC, analogous to approved radioligand therapies in other cancers​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
.

PROTACs (Targeted Protein Degraders): Proteolysis-targeting chimeras are bifunctional molecules that tag specific proteins for destruction by the cell’s own ubiquitin-proteasome system. A handful of PROTACs have been designed against TNBC-relevant targets and tested in TNBC cell lines and mouse models​
MDPI.COM
. These PROTACs successfully degraded their target oncoproteins and suppressed TNBC tumor growth in preclinical studies​
MDPI.COM
. For instance, PROTACs against estrogen-related receptor or against BET bromodomain proteins have shown potent anti-TNBC effects in vitro. However, none have reached clinical trials in TNBC yet, partly due to challenges like large molecular size and pharmacokinetic limitations​
MDPI.COM
. Refinement of PROTAC chemistry continues, as this technology could open up many formerly “undruggable” targets in TNBC for therapeutic intervention.

Key Takeaway: Multiple targeted therapy avenues are being pursued in TNBC’s preclinical space. These range from inhibitors of DNA repair and signaling pathways to novel therapeutic modalities like epigenetic drugs, peptide inhibitors, ADCs, radioligands, and protein degraders. Each is often linked to a specific biomarker – for example, BRCA mutations for PARP inhibitor sensitivity, AR expression for anti-androgen therapy, or Trop-2 for ADC targeting. The ultimate goal is to personalize TNBC treatment by matching patients with the targeted strategy most likely to work for their tumor’s molecular profile.

Immunotherapy Approaches in Preclinical Research
Immunotherapy has brought new hope to TNBC treatment, as this subtype often provokes immune recognition due to its high mutational load and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Several immunotherapeutic strategies are being investigated in preclinical models and early trials for TNBC, aiming to boost the patient’s immune system to attack cancer cells:

Immune Checkpoint Blockade: TNBC was among the first breast cancer subtypes to show benefit from checkpoint inhibitors. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors have demonstrated durable antitumor activity in TNBC, especially in tumors with pre-existing immune infiltrates. A landmark clinical breakthrough was the KEYNOTE-522 trial, which in 2020 showed that adding pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased pathologic complete response rates and improved event-free survival in early-stage TNBC​
MDPI.COM
​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. This led to FDA approval of pembrolizumab for high-risk early TNBC, establishing immunotherapy as part of the standard regimen​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Building on this success, ongoing preclinical research is exploring additional checkpoints like CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIGIT in TNBC. Trials are underway combining dual checkpoint blockade (e.g. PD-1 plus CTLA-4 inhibition) to further unleash T-cell activity. Moreover, researchers are investigating biomarkers beyond PD-L1 – such as gene expression signatures of an “immune hot” tumor – to better predict which early-stage TNBC patients will benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy​
MDPI.COM
.

Combination Immunotherapy Strategies: Given that not all TNBC patients respond to single-agent immunotherapy, there is intense interest in combination approaches to enhance immune responses. Preclinical studies have shown that rational combinations can convert immunologically “cold” TNBC tumors into “hot” ones. One approach is combining checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies or chemotherapy to promote tumor antigen release and T-cell infiltration. For example, PARP inhibitors can increase tumor mutational burden and DNA fragments, potentially stimulating immune recognition; indeed, combinations of the PARP inhibitor niraparib with pembrolizumab, and olaparib with durvalumab, have yielded promising response rates in trials​
MDPI.COM
. Another strategy is adding epigenetic modulators (like HDAC inhibitors) to upregulate MHC and antigen presentation in TNBC cells – an ongoing trial of entinostat with pembrolizumab in TNBC is based on this rationale​
MDPI.COM
. Researchers are also evaluating immunotherapy plus anti-angiogenic therapy (to normalize tumor vasculature and improve immune cell access) and immunotherapy plus radiotherapy (taking advantage of radiation’s immunogenic effects). Early TNBC trials such as I-SPY2 are using adaptive designs to test some of these novel combinations. Overall, the preclinical consensus is that multi-modal therapy – pairing immunotherapy with other treatments – may overcome resistance mechanisms and achieve deeper responses​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
.

CAR T Cells and T Cell–Redirecting Therapies: Another frontier in TNBC immunotherapy is adoptive cell therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR T) cells, which are patient T cells engineered to target a specific tumor antigen, have shown success in blood cancers and are now being applied to TNBC. Solid tumor CAR T development is challenging, but TNBC expresses certain surface antigens suitable for CAR targeting. Notably, ROR1 and MUC1 are two antigens overexpressed in TNBC and associated with cancer stem cell populations. CAR T cells against ROR1 and MUC1 have demonstrated promising antitumor activity in preclinical TNBC models, effectively killing TNBC cells in vitro and reducing tumor growth in mice​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. These encouraging results have led to early-phase clinical trials of CAR T therapy in breast cancer. Additionally, bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), which are antibodies engineered to bind a T cell (via CD3) on one end and a tumor antigen on the other, are being designed for TNBC targets like Trop-2 or EpCAM. A bispecific antibody (catumaxomab) targeting EpCAM and CD3 showed the ability to eliminate chemoresistant TNBC cells in preclinical studies​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
, hinting at the potential of T-cell redirection strategies. While issues like T-cell trafficking into tumors and antigen heterogeneity must be addressed, these cell-based therapies could provide a highly personalized attack on TNBC lesions in the future.

Cancer Vaccines: Therapeutic vaccines are under development to train the patient’s immune system to recognize and destroy TNBC cells or cancer stem cells before they can recur. A wide array of tumor-associated antigens is being explored for TNBC vaccines, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease. For example, vaccines targeting proteins such as folate receptor alpha (FRα), α-lactalbumin, MUC1, CEA, brachyury, XBP1, and survivin – all of which can be expressed by TNBC tumor cells – have shown immunogenicity in preclinical models​
MDPI.COM
. Vaccines directed at cancer stem cell markers (like CD105 or SOX2) are also in development to eliminate the therapy-resistant subpopulation of cells​
MDPI.COM
. These vaccines employ various platforms (peptide-based, DNA/mRNA vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, viral vectors) and have reached early clinical trials. As of late 2024, dozens of vaccine trials in TNBC are ongoing​
MDPI.COM
. One example is a phase III trial of a Globo H carbohydrate antigen vaccine (OBI-822/821) in Globo H–positive TNBC patients​
MDPI.COM
 – if successful, this could become one of the first approved vaccines for breast cancer. Often, vaccines are being tested in combination with checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy to maximize immune activation​
MDPI.COM
. While no TNBC vaccine has reached the market yet, recent advances in mRNA vaccine technology and neoantigen identification (via sequencing and machine learning) are accelerating the discovery of potent vaccine targets for TNBC.

Other Innovative Immunotherapies: Additional immunotherapy approaches in preclinical exploration include oncolytic viruses (engineered viruses that selectively infect and destroy tumor cells while alerting the immune system), immune modulatory antibodies (agonists of co-stimulatory receptors like OX40 or inhibitors of suppressive signals like TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment), and innate immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., blocking CD47 “don’t eat me” signals to enhance macrophage-mediated clearance of TNBC cells). For instance, blocking the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway with ruxolitinib is being studied to diminish immunosuppressive cytokine signals and reduce TNBC stem-like cells​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Early research has also identified novel immunotherapy targets such as Mga, a transcriptional regulator that may influence immune evasion, opening up new immunological intervention points​
MDPI.COM
. These cutting-edge therapies are still largely in the laboratory or phase I stage, but they represent the next wave of immunotherapy concepts aimed at making TNBC more susceptible to immune attack.

Key Takeaway: Immunotherapy research in TNBC is rapidly expanding. In early-stage disease, integrating checkpoint inhibitors has already shown a major breakthrough, and now combination approaches, CAR T cells, vaccines, and other immunotherapies are being developed to further improve outcomes. Identifying which patients are most likely to benefit (via immune biomarkers) and how to convert non-responders into responders (through combination treatments) are central goals guiding these preclinical immunotherapy studies.

Promising Drug Targets and Experimental Treatments
Research is continually uncovering new biomarkers and drug targets in TNBC that could lead to future therapies. Below are some of the most promising targets and experimental treatments emerging from recent studies:

BRCA1/2 and Homologous Recombination Deficiency: Defects in BRCA-driven DNA repair pathways are a key vulnerability in TNBC. PARP inhibitors exploit this by trapping DNA repair complexes and causing cell death in BRCA-mutant cells​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Ongoing research is extending this concept to BRCA-like TNBC that have a homologous recombination defect without a BRCA mutation, aiming to broaden the patient population that could benefit from PARP inhibition or similar synthetic lethal strategies.

Androgen Receptor (AR): Approximately 10–20% of TNBCs express AR (the LAR subtype). AR antagonists (enzalutamide, bicalutamide) and novel AR degraders are being tested to treat this subset. Preclinical evidence of AR pathway blockade slowing TNBC growth, and early clinical signals of efficacy​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
, make AR a viable target. Trials are also combining AR inhibition with agents like PI3K inhibitors or CDK4/6 inhibitors to tackle the adaptive resistance mechanisms in AR+ TNBC​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
.

EGFR and HER Family: EGFR is overexpressed in a significant fraction of TNBC and correlates with the basal-like subtype. Although anti-EGFR therapies alone have had limited success in unselected TNBC, they remain a focus in combination therapies and in specific contexts (such as EGFR-overexpressing or PTEN-low tumors)​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Additionally, some TNBC tumors have low levels of HER2 (so-called HER2-low breast cancers). These might be candidates for HER2-targeted ADCs (like trastuzumab-deruxtecan) which can kill HER2-low TNBC cells – an approach currently under investigation given recent successes of such ADCs in other HER2-low breast cancers.

PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway: As noted, inhibitors of this pathway (e.g. AKT inhibitors like ipatasertib or capivasertib) are in trials for TNBC. A subset of TNBC with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN loss could particularly benefit​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Targeting PI3K/AKT may also enhance the efficacy of other treatments; for example, dual inhibition of PI3K and PD-1 is being explored to reverse immune resistance, since PI3K pathway activation in tumors can create an immunosuppressive microenvironment.

NOTCH, Wnt, and Other Stem Cell Pathways: TNBC tumor-initiating cells (cancer stem cells) rely on developmental pathways like Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, and JAK/STAT. Inhibitors of these pathways are promising for eliminating the chemoresistant cell subpopulations that drive relapse. Preclinically, blocking Notch signaling with a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT), Wnt with inhibitors like Salinomycin, or JAK/STAT with agents like Stattic or ruxolitinib has reduced TNBC stem cell self-renewal and tumor-initiation capacity​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. A gamma-secretase inhibitor (PF-03084014) has even advanced to clinical trials in TNBC, testing whether Notch blockade can improve outcomes for patients with advanced TNBC​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Targeting these pathways could prevent recurrence when added to standard therapy, and represents an ongoing opportunity for drug development.

Tumor Microenvironment Targets: Novel targets are also being sought in the TNBC microenvironment. For instance, CSF-1R inhibitors aim to deplete immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages, and CXCR2/CXCR1 inhibitors (like reparixin) are being tested to disrupt inflammatory signals that support cancer stem cells​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. While a phase II trial of reparixin in metastatic TNBC did not significantly improve outcomes​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
, these approaches are still being refined. TGF-β signaling, which fosters immune evasion and metastasis, is another target; inhibitors of TGF-β are being combined with immunotherapy in trials to see if they can boost response rates in TNBC. Each of these microenvironment-focused treatments addresses the context in which TNBC grows, rather than the tumor cell directly, and may work best in combination with direct tumor-killing agents.

Next-Generation Immunotherapy Targets: Beyond PD-1 and CTLA-4, emerging checkpoints and immune regulators are under exploration in TNBC. Antibodies targeting LAG-3 and TIGIT (checkpoint receptors on T cells) are in trials for various cancers and could be especially relevant for TNBC in combination with PD-1 blockade. In parallel, strategies to activate innate immunity are being studied – for example, antagonists of CD47 (to enhance macrophage phagocytosis of TNBC cells) and agonists of STING or TLR9 (to stimulate interferon production and dendritic cell activation) are showing promise in preclinical models of TNBC. These agents could help convert immunologically cold tumors into hot ones that respond to checkpoint inhibitors.

Therapeutic Modalities in Development: Lastly, researchers are expanding the arsenal of treatment modalities for TNBC. Bispecific antibodies that engage T cells to attack TNBC cells (as noted with EpCAM-targeted bispecifics) are being engineered for higher efficacy and tested in models​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Oncolytic virotherapy is being tailored to TNBC; for example, an oncolytic adenovirus expressing GM-CSF (to attract immune cells) is in early testing. And mRNA-based therapies – whether for cancer vaccination or for delivering gene-editing tools like CRISPR to the tumor – are on the horizon, thanks to the success of mRNA platforms in other contexts. While these treatments are experimental, they represent opportunities for drug development that could significantly expand how we treat TNBC in the future.

Recent Breakthroughs
The TNBC field has seen several encouraging breakthroughs in recent years, validating some targeted and immunotherapy approaches and informing future research:

Immunotherapy in Early TNBC: The addition of pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been a game-changer for early-stage TNBC, as evidenced by the KEYNOTE-522 trial. This regimen significantly improved the pathological complete response rate and reduced recurrence, leading to regulatory approval and a new standard of care​
MDPI.COM
​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. This success proves that TNBC, once thought unresponsive to targeted therapy, can benefit from immunotherapy, and it encourages testing of other immunotherapies in the curative (early-stage) setting. Concurrently, atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) showed benefits in metastatic TNBC (IMpassion130 trial) and is being evaluated in earlier-stage disease as well. These milestones mark the first effective targeted treatment (immunotherapy) for TNBC outside of chemotherapy.

PARP Inhibitor Advances: PARP inhibitors have transitioned from theory to practice in TNBC. Olaparib and talazoparib improved outcomes in BRCA-mutated metastatic TNBC (OlympiAD and EMBRACA trials)​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. Importantly, the recent OlympiA phase III trial in early breast cancer (including TNBC with BRCA mutations) demonstrated that adjuvant olaparib after standard therapy significantly prolongs survival for high-risk patients​
FRONTIERSIN.ORG
. This is a breakthrough for targeted therapy in early TNBC – for the first time, a molecularly targeted pill has been shown to reduce recurrence in the curative setting. Based on these results, clinicians are now incorporating genetic testing for BRCA in TNBC management to identify candidates for PARP inhibitor therapy. Efforts are ongoing to extend this approach to patients without germline BRCA mutations but with BRCA-like genomic scars or other DNA repair deficiencies.

Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs): The approval of sacituzumab govitecan for metastatic TNBC in 2020 was a significant achievement, offering a new line of therapy for patients who progress on standard chemotherapy. This Trop-2–directed ADC demonstrated a survival benefit over chemotherapy in heavily pretreated TNBC​
MDPI.COM
. Its success has spurred a wave of ADC development for TNBC. For example, clinical trials are evaluating trastuzumab deruxtecan (an anti-HER2 ADC) in HER2-low TNBC populations, and ladiratuzumab vedotin (anti-LIV-1 ADC) in metastatic TNBC. ADCs blur the line between targeted therapy and chemotherapy, delivering toxic drugs selectively to cancer cells. The breakthroughs in ADC efficacy suggest that even “undruggable” TNBC can be attacked by coupling a cytotoxin to the right targeting antibody.

CAR T Cell Therapy Progress: While still early, there have been notable steps forward in CAR T therapy for TNBC. Case reports from trials of ROR1 CAR T-cells have shown evidence of tumor shrinkage in metastatic TNBC patients, indicating that CAR T cells can traffic to and act on breast tumors in vivo. Researchers have also developed armoring strategies (e.g., CAR T cells secreting checkpoint blockade antibodies or IL-12) to help them overcome the hostile tumor microenvironment. The first-in-human studies targeting MUC1* (a cleaved form of MUC1 on TNBC cells) are underway. Although no CAR T has been approved for solid tumors yet, these advances are proof-of-concept that personalized cell therapy could eventually benefit TNBC patients, possibly as an adjunct after surgery to eradicate minimal residual disease.

Novel Agents Entering Trials: Several cutting-edge therapies have recently made the leap from preclinical research into clinical trials, representing breakthroughs in translational progress. Omomyc (MYC inhibitor), as mentioned, is one of the first direct MYC-targeting agents to be tested in humans, including TNBC patients​
MDPI.COM
. The mere fact that a transcription factor inhibitor is in trials is a breakthrough, potentially paving the way for targeting other “master regulators” of TNBC. Another example is pelareorep, an oncolytic virus being tested in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in breast cancer, which could provoke immune responses against TNBC. Additionally, the identification of Globo H and other glycan antigens highly expressed in TNBC has led to late-stage vaccine trials – a milestone for cancer vaccines which historically have struggled to reach phase III. Each of these represents a tangible step towards broadening TNBC treatment options beyond conventional methods.

Challenges and Opportunities in TNBC Therapy Development
Despite the progress, significant challenges remain in bringing targeted and immunotherapies to all patients with early-stage TNBC. Understanding these hurdles is crucial for guiding future research and exploiting new opportunities:

Tumor Heterogeneity: TNBC’s profound interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity is the foremost challenge​
MDPI.COM
. No single molecular driver dominates TNBC; instead, each tumor may have a unique constellation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. A targeted drug may therefore only benefit a small subset of patients whose tumors harbor the corresponding vulnerability​
MDPI.COM
. Moreover, TNBC cells can evolve and change subtype over time or under treatment pressure​
MDPI.COM
. This plasticity means a therapy effective at first may lose effectiveness as the tumor adapts. To overcome heterogeneity, comprehensive tumor profiling (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) is needed for each patient, and treatment may need to be individualized or dynamically adjusted. Opportunity: Advanced tools like single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics are now being used to map the diverse cell populations within TNBC tumors and their microenvironments​
MDPI.COM
. These techniques can reveal resistant subclones and immune evasion tactics, informing combination therapies or sequential treatments to preempt tumor adaptation.

Lack of Universal Biomarkers: Related to heterogeneity is the scarcity of robust predictive biomarkers for new therapies. For example, PD-L1 is used to select some TNBC patients for immunotherapy, but it is an imperfect marker – some PD-L1–positive tumors do not respond, and some PD-L1–negative tumors do respond​
MDPI.COM
. Similarly, there is no agreed marker to predict benefit from EGFR inhibitors or immunomodulators in TNBC. This makes trial design and patient selection difficult, potentially diluting observable benefits. Opportunity: A concerted effort is underway to identify biomarker signatures (gene expression profiles, immune cell infiltration patterns, DNA damage scores, etc.) that correlate with response to specific treatments. Multivariate biomarkers or composite scores may perform better than single markers. For instance, an “immune score” that combines PD-L1 level, TIL count, and interferon-gamma gene signature might better predict immunotherapy response than any single factor. In targeted therapy, functional assays (like homologous recombination deficiency tests for PARP inhibitor candidates) are being refined to complement genomic markers. The development of reliable biomarkers will enable more efficient, adaptive clinical trials – matching patients to therapies they are most likely to benefit from and accelerating drug development.

Therapy Resistance: TNBC tumors often rapidly develop resistance to therapy, whether it is chemotherapy, targeted agents, or immunotherapy. Multiple mechanisms underlie this: drug efflux pumps (ABC transporters) can eject chemotherapy; activation of compensatory pathways can bypass a blocked target; cancer stem cells can weather treatments and reseed tumors; and immune escape can occur via upregulation of alternative checkpoints or loss of antigen presentation​
MDPI.COM
​
MDPI.COM
. In TNBC, redundant signaling pathways (like TGF-β, Notch, Wnt, NF-κB, JAK/STAT) can substitute for each other, making it hard to eradicate tumors with a single-target drug​
MDPI.COM
. Opportunity: To tackle resistance, researchers are exploring rational combination therapies (hitting multiple pathways at once) and sequential therapy strategies (to prevent or delay resistance). For example, combining a PARP inhibitor with an immune checkpoint inhibitor can exploit DNA repair dysfunction while simultaneously activating T cells, potentially preventing tumor cells from escaping via either mechanism​
MDPI.COM
. Similarly, adding therapies that target stem cell pathways (Notch/Wnt) after initial chemo could eliminate the residual resistant cells​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. Another opportunity is the use of adaptive clinical trial designs where treatment can be switched based on early indicators of resistance (such as circulating tumor DNA dynamics). By anticipating resistance, future TNBC therapies might keep the cancer off-balance and improve long-term cure rates.

Translational Gaps: Many agents that show promise in TNBC cell lines or mouse models fail to make an impact in clinical trials. Bridging this gap requires better preclinical models that more faithfully represent human TNBC – including its heterogeneity and the human immune system. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoid models, which maintain the complexity of actual tumors, are being used to test drugs and drug combinations​
MDPI.COM
. However, PDX models are costly and labor-intensive, and they lack an intact immune system if mice are used. Opportunity: The development of humanized mouse models (mice engrafted with human immune cells alongside the tumor) is one approach to test immunotherapies preclinically. Additionally, computational modeling and AI are being applied to TNBC datasets to predict effective drug combinations and optimal treatment schedules​

Clinical Trial Challenges in Early-Stage TNBC: Early-stage TNBC patients typically undergo surgery and (neo)adjuvant therapy with curative intent, which complicates trial design for new agents. Unlike metastatic TNBC where novel drugs can be tested for tumor shrinkage or survival benefit, in early TNBC the endpoint is often prevention of recurrence – requiring long follow-up to see if the investigational therapy adds benefit. The aggressive nature of TNBC means relapses often happen within 1–3 years, so trials must be well-timed and closely monitored​

. Another challenge is ethical – giving a novel drug to early-stage patients who might be cured with standard therapy needs strong justification (a high relapse risk or biomarker indicating likely benefit). Opportunity: Neoadjuvant trials (giving therapy before surgery) offer a solution by using pathologic complete response as a surrogate endpoint, which is predictive of long-term outcome in TNBC. This allows faster readouts of efficacy for new treatments. The FDA’s accelerated approvals for pembrolizumab and sacituzumab in TNBC were built on such surrogate endpoints. Additionally, adaptive trials like I-SPY2, which enroll early breast cancer patients including TNBC, use innovative statistical methods to identify effective regimens in small cohorts and graduate them to larger trials​

. These trial designs, along with international collaboration, are accelerating the evaluation of emerging therapies in the early-stage setting. The field is also moving toward window-of-opportunity trials, where patients receive an experimental agent for a short period between diagnosis and surgery to glean biological effects on the tumor. Such approaches can quickly indicate if a drug is hitting its target and altering tumor biology as expected.

In summary, TNBC remains a challenging adversary due to its heterogeneity, adaptability, and lack of easy targets. However, the convergence of better molecular understanding, innovative therapies, and smarter clinical trial designs provides a roadmap to improve outcomes. Precision medicine approaches that tailor treatments to a tumor’s specific genomic and immune profile are at the forefront of TNBC research​

. While obstacles like resistance and patient selection are significant, they also highlight where scientific innovation is needed.

Conclusion
Early-stage TNBC has historically been treated with a one-size-fits-all approach of surgery and intensive chemotherapy. Today, that paradigm is shifting as targeted therapies and immunotherapies move into the TNBC arena. Preclinical research is driving this shift by uncovering new facets of TNBC biology – from DNA repair defects to immune evasion mechanisms – and by providing novel therapeutic tools to exploit these weaknesses. The latest approaches under investigation include PARP inhibitors for DNA-damage repair defects, kinase inhibitors for growth and survival pathways, AR antagonists for the LAR subtype, epigenetic drugs to re-sensitize tumors, and a range of immunotherapies (checkpoints, CAR T cells, vaccines) to harness the immune system against TNBC. Many of these strategies are already showing promise in laboratory models and early trials, laying the groundwork for more effective, less toxic treatments. Recent successes like pembrolizumab in neoadjuvant therapy and sacituzumab in drug-resistant disease illustrate how research breakthroughs can rapidly translate into clinical benefit for patients​

. Nonetheless, the momentum in the field is strong – with numerous ongoing trials and a robust pipeline of preclinical candidates – and the outlook for early-stage TNBC patients is gradually improving. By continuing to explore TNBC’s molecular pathways and leveraging new therapeutic technologies, researchers are identifying opportunities for drug development that could one day make personalized therapy a reality for TNBC. In a disease known for its paucity of targets, the expanding array of targeted agents and immunotherapies offers a hopeful path to reduce recurrence and improve survival in this high-risk breast cancer subtype. The coming years will be critical to validate these approaches and overcome remaining obstacles, ultimately moving the needle closer to a cure for TNBC.
